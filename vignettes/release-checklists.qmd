## Release Checklist

 - [ ] Create a new branch from `main` called `<author>/release/<X.Y.Z>` (e.g. `ls/release/0.1.6`)
 - [ ] Update version number in DESCRIPTION and check that the `Remotes:` is
       up-to-date
 - [ ] Update NEWS for the changes in this version
 - [ ] commit, push changes, and create pull request (tests will run against the released versions of the dependencies)
 - [ ] get a review from another member of the Hubverse dev team and merge on approval
 - [ ] add new tag (annotated (`-a`) or signed (`-s`) preferred) with the name "<package> X.Y.Z" and push
      
      ```bash
      # example: create a signed (-s) tag for version 3.3.3
      git tag -s 3.3.3 -m '<short explanation of what changed>'
      git push --tags
      ```
 - [ ] create a release on github from the new tag

## Post Release Checklist

Immediately after the release, follow these steps to set the version back to
development

 - [ ] Create new branch from main called `post-release-X.Y.Z`
 - [ ] Add `.9000` to the version number in DESCRIPTION (to indicate in development version)
 - [ ] Add a new heading to NEWS.md: `## <package name> (development)`
 - [ ] commit, push changes, create a pull request
 - [ ] merge (with or without approval)

## Subsequent PR Checklist

Subsequent PRs are business-as-usual development. All PRs are tested against
the development versions of packages and must work before being merged.

It is important to remember that PRs should focus on _independent features_. If
you want add a new feature and fix a bug, these should be two separate PRs. This
strategy _reduces the size of the PR, making it easier to review_.

 - [ ] Create a new branch from main called `<initials>/<feature>/<issue>`.
       (e.g.
       [`ak/change-check-fail-class-and-print/111`](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubValidations/pull/114),
       which was authored by Anna Krystalli to change the check/fail class and
       print methods to fix [issue
       #111](https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubValidations/issues/111)).
 - [ ] Update NEWS.md (be sure to acknowledge non-core contributors by tagging
       their GitHub handle and version number)
 - [ ] Get review from a member of the hubverse team and merge into main on approval.


Caveats:

 1. You should not change the development version number, **unless
    there are important feature changes that are required by an upstream
    package** (see [more about the development version number](#dev)).
 2. Review often brings up potential non-blocking features/bug fixes that are
    orthogonal to the original PR. In these cases, instead of creating a PR to
    merge into the original PR, it's best to **create a new issue from the PR
    review** and, after merging, **create a new PR to fix that issue**. This
    helps keep disparate bugfixes and features separate.
 3. If introducing **breaking changes**, you must not merge into `main` until
    these changes have been tested and communicated with the community.

## Hotfix Checklist

A hotfix is a bug fix that is independent from in-development features and needs
to be deployed within a day. Details on hotfixes can be found in
`vignette("hotfixes", package = "hubDevs")`. To patch and release a hotfix,
follow this protocol:

 - [ ] Create a new branch from the latest tag using `<author>/<hotfix>/<issue>` (MUST be this pattern)
   ```sh
   (main)$ git switch --detach 0.14.0 # checkout the tag
   ((0.14.0))$ git switch -c znk/hotfix/143 # create a new branch
   (znk/hotfix/143)$
   ```
 - [ ] Write a test, fix the bug, commit, and push 
       **(do not bump the version number yet)**
   ```sh
   (znk/hotfix/143)$ git commit -m 'hotfix for #143'
   (znk/hotfix/143)$ git push -u origin znk/hotfix/143 # push the hotfix
   ```
 - [ ] Create a pull request, get a review from another hubverse developer, and confirm that checks pass against the released versions of the packages **(Do not merge yet)**
 - [ ] Update the NEWS and bump the [patch version](#patch) in the DESCRIPTION
 - [ ] Release from the hotfix branch
   ```sh
   (znk/hotfix/143)$ git commit -m 'bump version to 0.14.1'
   (znk/hotfix/143)$ git tag -s 0.14.1 -m 'flipped retroencabulator switch option'
   (znk/hotfix/143)$ git push
   (znk/hotfix/143)$ git push --tags
   ```
   At this point, there will be a conflict on the NEWS and DESCRIPTION, but
   that's because you confirmed that it worked in the previous step.
 - [ ] Create the release from the tag on github or using GitHub's CLI tool: 
   `gh release create 0.14.1`
 - [ ] Resolve conflicts in PR and merge into main.
