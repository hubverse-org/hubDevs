title: "Releasing Hotfixes"
---

A hotfix is a bug fix for a situation where a bug has been found, but the main
branch has new features that are not yet ready to be released. This chapter will
be a walkthrough of a scenario with a diagram of the status of the Git
repository during each iteration. This was the process used in
[carpentries/sandpaper#539](https://github.com/carpentries/sandpaper/pull/539)
to resolve a bug in link processing.

Take for example a situation where you want to introduce two new features into
the project, so you create two branches for each of them. You finish the first
and merge it into the main branch and you are still working on the second. Your
Git graph might look something like this:


```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id: "abcd"
    commit id: "efgh" tag: "0.14.0"
    branch feature1
    branch feature2
    checkout main
    checkout feature1
    commit id: "ijkl"
    commit id: "mnop"
    checkout main
    merge feature1 id: "gpne"
    checkout feature2
    commit id: "qrst"
    commit id: "uvwx"
```


## Step 1: Create a Fix and Pull Request

Then, you get a report (let's call it issue number 143) that something is broken
and you need to fix it immediately. Normally, to fix bugs, you would check out a
new bugfix branch from the `main` branch. Here's the catch: if you check out
from the main branch you will grab `feature1` as well, which is not yet ready
for production because you intended `feature2` to be released along side. In
this case, you need to create a hotfix, and create the branch _from the last
tag_:

```sh
git switch --detach 0.14.0 # checkout the tag
git switch -c hotfix-143 # create a new branch
# do some work
git commit -m 'hotfix for #143'
```

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id: "abcd"
    commit id: "efgh" tag: "0.14.0"
    branch feature1
    branch feature2
    branch hotfix-143
    checkout main
    checkout feature1
    commit id: "ijkl"
    commit id: "mnop"
    checkout main
    merge feature1 id: "gpne"
    checkout feature2
    commit id: "qrst"
    commit id: "uvwx"
    checkout hotfix-143
    commit id: "yzAB"
```


Once you have made your hotfix (with a test of course, because we always make
sure to verify our fixes), then you should push it up and open a pull request:

```sh
git push -u origin hotfix-143
```

## Step 2: Run Integration Test, Bump the Version and Add a Tag

You should check that the hotfix does not break any existing tests AND you
should check the [Workbench Integration
Test](https://github.com/carpentries/workbench-integration-test#readme) with the
pull request you just created and the repository that is reporting the error.

Once you have confirmed that everything works as expected, the next step is to
bump the version and add a tag. This tag will allow you to release the patch
version.

```sh
nano DESCRIPTION # bump the patch version
nano NEWS.md     # add a new section describing the bug fix
git add DESCRIPTION NEWS.md
git commit -m 'bump version to 0.14.1'
git tag -s 0.14.1 -m 'hotfix for 143'
git push
git push --tags
```


```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id: "abcd"
    commit id: "efgh" tag: "0.14.0"
    branch feature1
    branch feature2
    branch hotfix-143
    checkout main
    checkout feature1
    commit id: "ijkl"
    commit id: "mnop"
    checkout main
    merge feature1 id: "gpne"
    checkout feature2
    commit id: "qrst"
    commit id: "uvwx"
    checkout hotfix-143
    commit id: "yzAB"
    commit id: "CDEF" tag: "0.14.1"
```

At this point, the checks will not run on the pull request because there will be
a conflict in the DESCRIPTION and NEWS.md files. This is okay. All you did was
update the version numbers and add NEWS. The next step is to release the patch.

## Step 3: Release the Patch

You will release the patch using the same method as described in [the releases
chapter](releases). You can either release on GitHub directly or via the GitHub
CLI. Importantly, when you create the release, you should _create the release
from the new tag_:

```sh
gh release create 0.14.1
```

## Step 4: Resolve Conflicts and Merge

Now that you've created the release, you should resolve the conflicts in the
DESCRIPTION and NEWS files and then merge it back into `main` (note: this will
create two merge commits, but I'm only showing one in the diagram to make it
cleaner):

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id: "abcd"
    commit id: "efgh" tag: "0.14.0"
    branch feature1
    branch feature2
    branch hotfix-143
    checkout main
    checkout feature1
    commit id: "ijkl"
    commit id: "mnop"
    checkout main
    merge feature1 id: "gpne"
    checkout feature2
    commit id: "qrst"
    commit id: "uvwx"
    checkout hotfix-143
    commit id: "yzAB"
    commit id: "CDEF" tag: "0.14.1"
    checkout main
    merge hotfix-143 id: "DeFn"
```


Now you will have the patch in place for the released version _and_ the devel
version of The Workbench, which means that you can continue to develop as
normal and merge the next feature when you are ready:

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id: "abcd"
    commit id: "efgh" tag: "0.14.0"
    branch feature1
    branch feature2
    branch hotfix-143
    checkout main
    checkout feature1
    commit id: "ijkl"
    commit id: "mnop"
    checkout main
    merge feature1 id: "gpne"
    checkout feature2
    commit id: "qrst"
    commit id: "uvwx"
    checkout hotfix-143
    commit id: "yzAB"
    commit id: "CDEF" tag: "0.14.1"
    checkout main
    merge hotfix-143 id: "DeFn"
    checkout feature2
    commit id: "GHIJ"
    commit id: "KLMN"
    checkout main
    merge feature2 id: "FnNL"
```
